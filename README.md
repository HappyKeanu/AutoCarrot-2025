# AutoCarrot 2025

AutoCarrot is a lightweight World of Warcraft Classic addon that automatically equips the best riding-related gear when mounted and re-equips your normal gear when dismounted.

This is an updated version for Season of Discovery (SoD) and WotLK Classic, based on the original work by [kebabstorm](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/autocarrot).
